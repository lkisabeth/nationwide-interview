# AWS Bedrock Prompt Management MCP Server

## Project Summary

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides an interface to AWS Bedrock's Prompt Management features. The server allows AI assistants to discover, create, update, and execute prompts stored in an AWS Bedrock account, making it easier to integrate prompt management capabilities into generative AI applications.

## Key Features

1. **Prompt Discovery**: Find and list all prompts available in your AWS Bedrock account
2. **Prompt Creation**: Create new prompts with variables, system instructions, and model configurations
3. **Prompt Execution**: Execute prompts with variable values and get model responses
4. **Version Management**: Create and manage versions of prompts to track changes
5. **Metadata Management**: Store and retrieve custom metadata with prompts

## Technical Implementation

The implementation follows modern Python best practices and demonstrates the following concepts:

### Clean Architecture

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between models, clients, and server components
- **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are injected rather than hardcoded
- **Interface Abstraction**: Well-defined interfaces between components

### Python Best Practices

- **Type Annotations**: Comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase
- **Documentation**: Thorough docstrings and comments
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests with mocking

### MCP Protocol Implementation

- **Resource Definitions**: MCP resources for discovering available prompts
- **Tool Definitions**: Well-defined tools with clear parameter descriptions and examples
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Fully async implementation for better performance

### AWS Integration

- **Boto3 Clients**: Proper use of AWS SDK for Python (boto3)
- **Pagination Handling**: Correct handling of paginated API responses
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for AWS API calls

## Testing Strategy

The project includes comprehensive unit tests that demonstrate best practices:

1. **Isolated Tests**: Each component is tested in isolation with dependencies mocked
2. **Boundary Testing**: Tests cover edge cases and error conditions
3. **Mocking**: Proper use of mocking to simulate AWS API responses
4. **Async Testing**: Correct testing of asynchronous code

## Usage Examples

The sample client demonstrates how to use the MCP server in a real-world scenario:

1. Connect to the MCP server
2. Discover available prompts
3. Create a new prompt with variables
4. Execute the prompt with specific variable values
5. Parse and process the response

## Development Setup

The project includes everything needed for development:

1. **Project Configuration**: pyproject.toml with dependencies and metadata
2. **Development Tools**: Configuration for linting, formatting, and testing
3. **Run Script**: Easy-to-use run script for testing the server
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and usage examples

## AI Integration Opportunities

This MCP server can be used to enhance AI assistants in several ways:

1. **Prompt Library Access**: AI assistants can access a library of pre-defined prompts
2. **Prompt Optimization**: Assistants can help optimize prompts by testing variations
3. **Dynamic Prompt Creation**: Assistants can create prompts dynamically based on user needs
4. **Versioning Management**: Assistants can track and manage prompt versions

## Demonstration of Technical Excellence

This project showcases several aspects of technical excellence:

1. **Modularity**: Components are well-separated and reusable
2. **Maintainability**: Code is clean, well-documented, and follows consistent patterns
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
5. **Documentation**: Clear and helpful documentation
6. **Modern Practices**: Use of modern Python features and best practices

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be made:

1. **Prompt Evaluation**: Add tools for evaluating prompt performance
2. **Prompt Sharing**: Enable sharing prompts across accounts
3. **Batch Operations**: Add support for batch operations on prompts
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Enhance prompt discovery with more advanced filtering
5. **Benchmarking**: Add tools for benchmarking prompt performance and cost
